# Simple Budget

Super simple budgeting tool that works the way I like. I have tried many
different budgeting apps and none of them work exactly the way i'd like.
Everyone is differnt.

UI is designed to be accessible from a phone only and there are purposely no
settings as the app works just for me.


## TODO:

- [ ] Setup very basic password protection
- [ ] Display safe to spend balances for the day/total for each budget
- [ ] Allow transactions to be modified
- [ ] Import existing data
- [ ] Deploy to heroku
- [ ] Setup colour schemes for good/bad/OK transactions (will depend on safe to spend value at the time)
- [ ] Setup routine to run before controller actions to update weekly deposits if out of date
